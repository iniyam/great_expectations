The Google Cloud Platform documentation describes how to verify our [authentication for the Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started), which includes:

1. Creating a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account,
2. Setting the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable,
3. Verifying authentication by running a simple [Google Cloud Storage client](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries) library script.
